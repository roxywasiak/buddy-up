# Buddy Up

This is an interactive app that allows students to find their ideal tutor to help further their skills in their chosen subject.

The app also allows students to find other students that they want to study with.

We allow students to find their perfect match within their are or remotely. We allow students to post adds so potential tutors can respond - we then render a match card for the student showing them they've been matched with a tutor.
